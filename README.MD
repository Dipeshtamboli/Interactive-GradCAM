# Interactive-GradCAM
The base code for this GradCAM visualization is written by [Jacob Gildenblat](https://github.com/jacobgil). The original code was for the PyTorch's pretrained Resnet-52 model. I have modified it for the customizable architectures([Modified VGG16 pretrained on COCO dataset](/home/dipesh/Interactive-GradCAM/Interactive_GradCAM_COCO.ipynb)).
